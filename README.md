## Executive Summary

The e-commerce sector is characterized by dynamic consumer behavior, intense competition, and the need for operational efficiency. This project delivers a structured analysis aimed at improving sales performance and optimizing inventory management through the use of Microsoft Excel-based analytics.

The analysis identifies critical business issues, including underperformance in specific product categories, limited focus on high-revenue products, and inefficiencies in inventory management. Through detailed evaluation of sales data and inventory trends, the project provides actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.

Key techniques such as sales performance evaluation and ABC classification are applied to segment products based on their revenue contribution. The findings are further translated into visual reports to facilitate business interpretation and communication.

This project enables stakeholders to:
- Identify and address low-performing product categories
- Focus on high-impact SKUs to drive revenue growth
- Streamline inventory management to reduce overstock and stockouts
- Improve overall profitability through targeted data-driven strategies

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance revenue generation and operational efficiency within the e-commerce industry by leveraging structured data analysis. Specifically, the project aims to:

- Understand and define core business challenges affecting profitability
- Access, clean, and transform raw datasets for analytical readiness
- Analyze sales performance across product categories and time periods
- Apply ABC analysis to classify products by revenue contribution
- Identify inventory inefficiencies and propose improvement strategies
- Develop working visualizations to support executive reporting

## Reporting and Communication

### Key Findings

The ABC analysis revealed that Class A products contribute 70% of total revenue, amounting to 880,744. Class B accounts for the next 25% (326,416), while Class C represents the remaining 5% (56,550). 

Top-performing products generate 469,161 in revenue, representing over half (53%) of the Class A total. In terms of product categories, Electronics leads with 369,663 in sales, followed by Beauty products contributing 302,541.

### Recommendations

- To enhance profitability, the business should prioritize Class A products through effective inventory management and targeted marketing strategies. Ensuring these high-performing items are consistently in stock will help prevent missed sales opportunities. Allocating additional marketing resources through targeted campaigns, upselling, and cross-selling can further drive revenue. Premium pricing or value-added promotions may also contribute to higher margins. 
- Class B products offer growth potential through strategic initiatives such as bundle deals and limited-time promotions. Identifying and engaging the right customer segments with personalized offers can boost sales, while reviewing customer feedback may reveal areas for product improvement.
- Class C products should be carefully assessed for potential phase-out or repositioning. Reducing inventory for underperforming items helps minimize holding costs, and where appropriate, clearance strategies like aggressive discounting can help liquidate stock.
- High-performing products such as Headphones, Biographies, and Shampoo can serve as anchors for cross-selling complementary items, increasing the overall basket size.
- Finally, strong performance in the Electronics and Beauty categories suggests opportunities for category expansion. Introducing new products, offering targeted promotions (e.g., category discounts or free shipping), and implementing loyalty programs can help capture greater market share and encourage repeat purchases.
